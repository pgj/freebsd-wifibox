        I declare that I have spent considerable amount of time on reading through the `wifibox(8)` and `wifibox-guest(5)` manual pages before creating this ticket.  I will not ask about things that are clearly documented there.  Maintainers reserve the right to leave such issues unanswered or close them immediately.  Thank you for saving them the time.
      options:
        - label: Yes, I have read all the manual pages first!
