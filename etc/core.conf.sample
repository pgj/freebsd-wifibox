# These are the default values that control the overall behavior of
# wifibox.

# Level of logging.  Verbosity increases in the following order.
#
# - none:  No messages are either displayed or logged.
# - error: Only error messages are displayed and logged.
# - warn:  Error and warning messages are displayed and logged.  That
#          is the default.
# - info:  Besides error and warning messages, informative messages
#          about the execution are logged.
# - debug: In addition to errors, warnings, and informative messages,
#          some extra information about the program's state is logged.
#          Useful for troubleshooting, but mostly makes sense when
#          read together with the source code.
